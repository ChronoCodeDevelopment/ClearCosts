<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal information or data from users of Clear Costs.</p>

<h2>Calendar Access</h2>
<p>Clear Costs requests access to your deviceâ€™s calendar in order to allow you to save expense-related events directly to your Apple Calendar. This access is solely used for the purpose of adding expenses as calendar events and is not used to collect or store any personal information. Clear Costs does not transmit or share calendar data with any third parties. You can choose whether to grant this permission, and you may revoke it at any time through your device settings.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Our app does not use any third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Since our app does not collect any personal data, there are no specific security measures in place to protect user data. Calendar access is used locally on your device and does not involve data transmission over the internet.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
